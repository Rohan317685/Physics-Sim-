Read Me:

This is a website based on a previous project where I made a 3d Phyics sandbox i was inspired by that and decided to make a 2d phyics sandbox with collision physics and I even added a demo where you cna move the bowling ball sort of if you want and you can customise your shape and change the gravity and the color affecting the blocks thselves and I spent quite a lot of time making it look professional etc.

You can play the sandbox through this link:

This took me 7 hours and I spent quite a lot of debugging etc but suprisingly it went smoother than expected so Im quite proud of that.
Ive used three.js and quite a few other mods and it is quite simple to try out there are 3 pages and a sort of slider on the top right where you can pick your pages etc
to select a specific shape you just need to click on it and drag if you want to move it or collide it with something else
